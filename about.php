<p id="about">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMario and Luigi opened their doors in 2012 in the Mushroom Kingdom's restaurant district.  It was here that they developed and perfected their pizza recipe along with the help of their friends Toad, Bowser, Princess Peach, and King Koopa.  Even though the economy has been bad, and the compitition (Donkey Kong's Diner) has been tough; they have managed to do exceptional well!  They are very excited you have chosen their establishment to serve you and hope you have a wonderful dining expirence.</p>
